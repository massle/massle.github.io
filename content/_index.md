Marcel Steinmetz is a research scientist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), currently conducting his research in the LAAS-CNRS labratory in Toulouse.
Prior to that, he did a postdoc at LAAS-CNRS and the University of Toulouse, preceded by a short postdoc stay in the Foundations of Artificial Intelligence group headed by JÃ¶rg Hoffmann at Saarland University, where he obtained his Ph.D end of 2022.

His primary research focus these days is on **trustworthy general-intelligent sequential decision-making**.
He has been working on various aspects gravitating around **AI planning**, amongst others, *conflict-driven learning techniques* in AI planning akin to clause learning in SAT; *MDP probabilistic planning* and *quantiative model checking*; planning with *description logics*; *explainable AI planning*; simulated network penetration testing and web-security analysis via AI planning methods; and testing and verifying machine-learned policies.
